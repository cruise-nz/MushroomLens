# Mushroom Classification: Predicting Edibility Using Machine Learning (MushroomLens)

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. Using a dataset containing categorical attributes of various mushroom species. The objective is to build an accurate and interpretable predictive model to assist in safe mushroom identification. The project includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature encoding, outlier detection), feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
